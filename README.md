Welcome to the Emotion Detector project developed during the Google AI Fest hackathon. This project focuses on recognizing human emotions using TensorFlow, a powerful deep learning framework.

## Overview

Emotion detection is a fascinating field with various applications in human-computer interaction, psychology, and marketing. In this project, we have created a deep learning model that can identify emotions in images of human faces.


## Repository Contents

- **hack.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook file is designed to be used in Google Colab. It contains the code for creating the emotion detection model using TensorFlow. You can use this notebook to train and evaluate the model.

- **hack.py**: This Python script leverages OpenCV to access the camera feed and apply the trained emotion detection model to recognize emotions in real-time. The detected emotions are then displayed on the screen.


## Features

- Emotion recognition in real-time.
- Pre-trained model for quick start.
- Customizable for different emotion sets.
- User-friendly graphical interface (GUI).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.10.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Numpy

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
